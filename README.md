# Timetable Parser

This Python-based project allows students at **Universitatea Babe»ô-Bolyai (UBB)** to easily convert their university timetable, which is published as an HTML file, into an `.ics` calendar file. This file can then be imported into Google Calendar or other calendar management applications, making it easy to keep track of lectures, seminars, and labs.

## Features

- Parses the university timetable from a provided HTML file.
- Converts the timetable into an `.ics` file compatible with most calendar apps.
- Customizable fields for easy modification by users.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UBB-timetable-parser.git
    cd UBB-timetable-parser
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    You may need some Python packages such as `ics`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Modify User-Specific Fields

Before running the script, you need to edit the following variables in the **`timetable_parser.py`** file to match your specific timetable setup:

```python
#------------------------USER EDIT ZONE---------------------------

url = "https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/files/orar/2024-1/tabelar/I2.html"  # URL of your timetable (HTML)
start_of_semester = datetime.datetime(year=2024, month=9, day=30)     # Start date of your semester
end_of_semester = datetime.datetime(year=2025, month=1, day=19)       # End date of your semester
timezone_adjustment = -3                                              # Timezone offset (e.g., -3 for UTC+3)
file_name = "timetable"                                               # Name of the output .ics file

#------------------------USER EDIT ZONE---------------------------
```

#### Explanation of Fields:
- **`url`**: The URL of your university timetable in HTML format. You can find this on the UBB website for your specific course/year.
- **`start_of_semester`**: The exact start date of your semester (e.g., the first day of classes).
- **`end_of_semester`**: The last day of your semester, including exams if necessary.
- **`timezone_adjustment`**: The difference in hours between your local time and UTC (e.g., `-3` for UTC+3).
- **`file_name`**: The desired name of the output `.ics` file.

### Step 2: Run the Script

After setting the correct fields, run the script, and it will download your timetable, parse it, and generate an `.ics` file in the project directory.

```bash
python timetable_parser.py
```

This will create an `ics` file (e.g., `timetable.ics`), which you can then import into Google Calendar or any other calendar application.

## Importing the .ICS File

1. **Google Calendar**:
   - Go to Google Calendar.
   - Click on the "gear" icon at the top-right corner and select "Settings".
   - On the left sidebar, find and click "Import & export".
   - Click "Select file from your computer" and choose the `.ics` file you generated.
   - Click "Import" and your timetable will appear in your calendar.

2. **Other Calendar Apps**:
   - Most calendar applications (Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.) also support `.ics` file imports. Look for a similar import feature and upload your generated `.ics` file.
